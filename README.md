### About Me
Currently attending Boise State University for Computer Science, graduating in May of 2026

### Projects
I have worked on many projects, primarily through schoolwork. My most recent personal
project has been recreating a playable Blackjack game in the Python terminal. Because
of my projects affiliation with Boise State, I'm unable to link them because of plagarism
issues. I'm more than happy, however, to show my school projects and answer any questions 
about them.
